            <p>I have always been fascinated with the internet and started teaching myself web development in early
                2022. I created this page to post about my
                hobbies and also showcase the different projects I have worked on. This page is UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
                Hopefully it won't be for too long. You can

                <h2>Site/Life Updates</h2>
                <p>10/27/23: <br /> Haven't really updated the site in the last few days. I got the <a
                        href="https://anbernic.com/products/new-anbernic-win600">Anbernic Win600</a> in the
                    mail the other day so i've been setting that up and tinkering with it. I've also been reading up on
                    responsive web development, like how to get websites to scale for phones
                    and tablets. I realized that the way i've shot myself in the foot with the way I have been coding
                    the website up until now.. There is a great possibility I will have to start
                    from scratch... But that's okay, it will be easier the second time around because I have all the
                    content to just cut and paste. I will definitely be changing the layout and color
                    scheme for the recipes page. I hate the way it looks right now. <br> One more thing... Today, one
                    month ago I started this website not expecting that anyone would care. So far i've
                    gotten 1,700 views which I think is pretty rad. Thank you all for finding something to enjoy here!
                    If there is something else you would like to see more/less of then please, reach out
                    to me at jholson.webdev@gmail.com I would love to hear from you!!</p>
                <p>10/22/23: <br /> Short update today. Added page two to the gallery. I was concerned with loading
                    times and the images appearing broken. I did, however, add more pictures!
                    Enjoy them!! Also most of my time for the forseeable future will be working on my 3rd Javascript
                    project, the calculator... This one is going to be tough but i'll
                    try to keep updating the site and adding new content.</p>
                <p>10/21/23: <br /> I decided to start work on a designated links page. I have so many awesome links to
                    websites I want to share and it would help with
                    de-cluttering the home page a bit. I applied to a few web-rings to help promote the site a bit and
                    it'll also give my users access to so many more websites
                    to check out. After thats done i'll start my research into how to make my site viewable on mobile
                    devices. Right now if you bring up the site on a Samsung or
                    iPhone it looks like a jumbled mess. Like it or not a large number of internet users are on
                    phones/tablets. I feel like Cricket deserves the extra audience. <br />
                    Speaking of Cricket, I saw a HUGE jump in page views after I added my gallery page, and since almost
                    half of those pics were of my cat I can conclude that you all
                    would probably like to see more of her. I'll make it happen!</p>
                <p>10/17/23: <br /> Decided to implement a new side bar navigation for the main site. It makes the page
                    look a lot more clean I think. My next big update over the next few weeks
                    will include additions to the pixel-art sketchpad. I would like to add a layering function to it.
                    Before I do that I need to add the ability to save
                    sketches to a .jpg file. I don't know what it is about that project.. I should be long done with it
                    but something keeps drawing me back to it (pun intended).
                    It will be interesting to see how far I wll take it, and how far off I will push off the calculator
                    project.. I started
                    Baldurs Gate 3 last night. Before I knew it I spent 5 hours on it and barely got through the
                    prologue. I'm using a half-drow sorcerer build. I've
                    always used sorcerers and monks for these types of games. I like it a lot, it reminds me a lot of
                    Neverwinter Nights 2 which was the last Wizards of
                    the Coast PC game I played. I can easily see myself sinking tons of time into this game if I'm not
                    careful.. Oh well :) more to come soon!</p>
                <p>10/15/23: <br /> It's been a little while since i've updated the site! I spent all of last week
                    drilling myself on Javascript array methods and
                    I succeeded on turning my brain to mush. Although it might help me a little bit down the line. Since
                    I'm a masochist for this sort of thing i'll
                    continue to try to up my Javascript game. Anyway, I finished the photo gallery. Right now it's just
                    pictures of my cat and some food i've cooked.
                    I'll keep adding more to it though! Also, as the site is growing and the number of links increases I
                    need to rework the site navigation and the header
                    is not a good place for them. I'll think of ideas on how I want to do it.</p>
                <p>10/5/23: <br /> I updated the to-do app and added a edit button and fixed the positioning. Didn't do
                    too much today. I had a seizure
                    this morning. It was my first one in almost 7 months.. I'll probably take tomorrow off from updating
                    the site. Next week i'll finish up
                    the to-do app then start on my next project, a Javascript calculator. I've been dreading this
                    project for some time now, but I need to just
                    make myself start on it... Also my mom got a new kitten today and named it Buttons. I'll put pics on
                    the photo gallery once I build it. That's
                    all for tonight!</p>
                <p>10/4/23 (part 2): <br /> As you can see I started fucking around with sprite sheets and getting them
                    to animate with CSS. I know they
                    look bad now, but rest assured... they will maybe get better? Who knows. Shit's gonna get goofy
                    around here though, thats for sure! </p>
                <p>10/4/23: <br /> I removed the copyright bullshit on the footers. I realize that it was stupid to have
                    that and then also say that
                    the code is free to use. u.u S0RrY!</p>
                <p>10/3/23: <br /> I finished the bulk of my latest project tonight. It's a Javascript to-do app. Super
                    simple stuff. I linked it
                    to my projects page. Everything is saved to local storage so your tasks will be saved to the
                    browser. Will also add a partyTime
                    button that will display cat memes. Because that's super important must have 10,000% and I will
                    fight anyone who says otherwise!</p>
                <p>10/2/23: <br /> Added a few new recipes to the recipe page. I took a break the last few days. I've
                    been working on coding
                    projects for the last 8 days in a row. Decided to finish my current play-through of Cyberpunk 2077.
                    Going to get Phantom
                    Liberty this week and check that out. I'm also planning on adding a responsive photo gallery
                    sometime this week as well. Also
                    I may move these updates to their own page. We'll see...</p>
                <p>9/29/23: <br /> Linked the recipe main page. It's just a stub for now. I'm working on the first
                    recipe, Baked Cavatelli, because I
                    just had that for dinner the other night. Also, I'm going to do something about all this
                    'blank-space' in the homepage. Probably just
                    fill it with cat memes. I'm still going to completely revamp the layout. I'm working on getting more
                    proficient in CSS Grid to
                    accomplish that. Until now i've just been using Flexbox but i've always wanted to learn Grid so here
                    we go!</p>
                <p>9/28/23: <br /> Changed the color scheme to a black and green/amber color you would see on an old
                    computer terminal. Paired that with
                    a brand new font that had the old school computer feel to it. Also added a digital clock to the
                    header. Next I was thinking since I have
                    the 'food' tag on this page I will be adding a recipe page of some of my favorite stuff to make!
                    Stay tuned!</p>
                <p>9/27/23: <br /> Added the About page and wrote some rambling shit about life and my dislike of modern
                    big tech companies. Also
                    added the main project's page. After that it won't take very long to upload the stuff I already have
                    done. Plus I'm getting a new font
                    for the website. The one I had looked like poo. Next I will get a better color scheme for the site.
                </p>
                <p>9/26/23: <br /> Published website and create very basic layout. Will probably revamp in the future.
                    This is my last day off
                    from a 6 day vacation. I was meaning to create this page much earlier but I got distracted by the
                    new v2.0 Cyberpunk 2077 update.
                    I'll try to hold off from getting Phantom Liberty for a few months. In addition to working on this
                    site I am starting my next
                    Javascript project, plus working my day job..</p>
